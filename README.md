## Introduction

Solve the lessons in [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/). Warning - they're tough! If you get stuck, reread the lesson to find what you need to use. Doing the lessons for the main section will take about 40 minutes. Doing the lessons for the remote section will take another 30 minutes.
